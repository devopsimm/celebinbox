        <h4>
            Clear GIFs Information:
        </h4>
        <p>
            When you use <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms, we may employ “clear GIFs” (aka Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The Way We Use Information
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms, then we will use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms or for customer service purposes).
        </p>
        <p>
            We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit <b>CelebInbox</b> Platforms; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
        </p>
        <h4>
            When We Disclose Information
        </h4>
        <p>
            We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with provincial and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CelebInbox</b> also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that the company believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, in order to take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend the company against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the company, our users or others.

        <h4>
            Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites
        </h4>
        <p>
            The company allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks the company to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of <b>CelebInbox</b> platforms, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt out of certain practices. The company’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control, the activities of other advertisers or websites.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Our Commitment to Data Security
        </h4>
        <p>
            The company uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the company and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, the company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the company learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. The company may post a notice on the website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us as provided in the section below, under the heading “Contact Information.”
